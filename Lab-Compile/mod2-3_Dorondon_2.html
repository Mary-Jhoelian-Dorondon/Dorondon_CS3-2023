			<p>This picture is from my favorite anime, Toilet Bound Hanako-kun. In this picture, we can see three of the main characters,
			Yashiro Nene, Hanako-kun, and Kou Minamoto. I love this picture because this somehow depicts the adventures, chaos, and fun
			in the show. So everyone, I highly recommend Toilet Bound Hanako-kun! As it is the anime that I love and adore.
