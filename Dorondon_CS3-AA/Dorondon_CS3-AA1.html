					<li>He Can't Be This Dumb</li>
						<p>I recommend this for new readers. Its plot is very interesting and the characters are just chefs kiss. Its art is also very fun and pleasing to the eye.</p>
					<li>Operation: True Love</li>
						<p>I love this manhwa! Everything about it is just so perfect to me, the art style, plot, and the characters' personalities and development. Overall, it is a very enjoyable read for new and old readers alike.</p>
					<li>Marry My Husband</li>
						<p>This manhwa is one of my favorites because it has in-depth backstories of both the protagonists and the villains. The art style emphasizes its impact and the characters’ emotions. I also loved the balance between action, supernatural, comedy, and family, as well as the romance between Yohan and Hayan.</p>
					<li>Villainess In Love</li>
						<p>The main characters' chemistry is impeccable. This manhwa is just so wholesome and so reader-friendly in a way that it makes you want to reread it again and again.</p>
					<li>Another Typical Fantasy Romance</li>
						<p>As it says in the title of the manhwa, this read is like another typical fantasy romance but since artists are striving to make their works complicated, this manhwa is like a fresh breeze to us readers. This manhwa is extremely wholesome and cute. I highly recommend it to new readers for a satisfying read.</p>

					<li>Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint</li>
						<p>A masterpiece! This manhwa has a complex, slow-paced plot with several developments and foreshadowing. It’s an emotional rollercoaster that truly encapsulates life, as well as what it means to grieve and hope. The art style is immaculate!</p>
					<li>Weak Hero</li>
						<p>I love this manhwa because it empowers the reader as a person. Everyone starts at the bottom as this seemingly weak minion but eventually makes their way to the top as the level 100 OP boss. It taught me not to underestimate people, that’s for sure.</p>
					<li>The Boxer</li>
						<p>This manhwa taught me the hard way of things and the dark side of the world. It’s a tough read because you’ll be slapped across the face with the reality of boxing. Overall, it was great.</p>
					<li>Eleceed</li>
						<p>The plot is amazing because it’s a perfect Halo-Halo bowl of action, comedy, and cuteness overload. I also adore the art style and OMG, Jiyoung is so attractive! </p>
					<li>Unholy Blood</li>
						<p>This manhwa is one of my favorites because it has in-depth backstories of both the protagonists and the villains. The art style emphasizes its impact and the characters’ emotions. I also loved the balance between action, supernatural, comedy, family, as well as the romance between Yohan and Hayan.</p>
